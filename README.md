## Issue

#### with symlink

the app doesn't reload when we change files in `./stories` Any help for that is welcome. I'm using symlink to add the stories's file into next's `pages`

so i'm trying to find an other way of doing it but i don't see any way to package a next app and just let the user create a folder to server as pages/ without all the next stuff (\_app, \_document, ...)
